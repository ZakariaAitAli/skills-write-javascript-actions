### Congratulations, you've completed this course!

In this course, you've learned a lot about developing custom actions using JavaScript and Actions Toolkit.

## Publishing your actions

Publishing your actions is a great way to help others in your team and across the GitHub community. Although actions do not need to be published to be consumed, by adding them to the marketplace you make them easier to find.

Some notable actions you will find on the marketplace are:

- [Actions for Discord](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/actions-for-discord)
- [GitHub Action for Slack](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-for-slack)
- [Jekyll action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jekyll-action)
- [Run Jest](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-jest)

And that just scratches the surface of the 1600+ and counting actions you will find on the marketplace

Follow [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace#publishing-an-action) to learn how to publish your actions to the GitHub Marketplace
